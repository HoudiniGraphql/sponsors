Let's write a short description of how all this works after somone [sponsors us](https://github.com/sponsors/HoudiniGraphql). (üôè Many thanks üíñ)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor YOU as You
    participant SP as Sponsoring Page
    Note right of SP: Webhook setup
    participant HS as Houdini Site
    Note right of HS: Handler with: WEBHOOK_PATH
    Note right of HS: Handler with: GITHUB_TOKEN
    participant SG as Repo Sponsors generator


    YOU->>+SP: New Sponsor üíñ
    SP->>+SP: GitHub Sponsor process
    SP->>+HS: Webhook (generate new asset)
    HS->>+SG: Webhook (trigger "update-sponsors" action)
    SG->>+SG: New Asset
    SG->>-YOU: You are on the asset üôè

```

## How update sponsors assets?

Call the workflow with the following command:

_`<YOUR-TOKEN>` Requires the `repo` scope._

```bash
curl -L \
  -X POST \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-TOKEN>" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \

  -d '{"ref":"main"}'
```
